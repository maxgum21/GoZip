- [x] Write first Go program
- [x] Learn about basic syntax (loops, arrays functions and classes)
- [x] Learn about memmory management in Go
- [x] Learn about file interaction with Go

[BST realizstion](Tree/Tree.md)
- [x] Make basic data-structures (Linked lists, binary trees)

- [ ] Write a Huffman tree encoder
- [ ] Learn about methods of creating compression dictionaries
- [ ] Write the encoder
